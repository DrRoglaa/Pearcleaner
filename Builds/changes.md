### What's New

- [x] BETA: New Updater view to handle App Store, Homebrew, Sparkle updates for installed apps. (Very very beta, Sparkle updater apps don't support in-app updating yet. I didn't have many apps needing updates to test all 3 sources with so very likely some bugs to be found!)
- [x] Default development environments selector to All if not empty on view load
- [x] Add more safeguards in place when fully uninstalling a macOS package and tweak related file search logic - #375
- [x] Permissions view sheet colors hard to see - #370
- [x] Add zed to dev environments - PR#374
- [x] Add uv to dev environments, misc changes - PR#373
- [x] Update translations
